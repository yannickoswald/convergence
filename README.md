 All relevant outputs figures for this paper are produced in Jupyter notebooks. These notebooks employ the classes that represent the actual model which are Python Files. 

 The model Python files are:

  1. country_class.py
  2. scenario_class.py
     
Supporting modelling files for plots are: 

  1. scenariosweeper_class (necessary for 2-d trade-offs plots)
  2. plots_class

The notebooks pertaining to the figure outputs of the paper are:

  1. first_data_explorations (This file contains a lot of initial data checks but also FIGURE1)
  2. run_figure2
  3. run_figure3
  4. run_figure4
  5. run_figure5

Notebooks that contain pre-modelling data processing are

  1. clean_extend_pip_data
